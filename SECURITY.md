## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Contact Information

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the scripts in the repository, please report it as an [Issue](https://github.com/ms1450/CommandConnectorCompatibilityCalculator/issues) in the repository. Otherwise, you can report it to Mehul at [mehul.sen@verkada.com](mailto:mehul.sen@verkada.com). If you prefer to keep your identity private, please use this email address for communication.

### Response Time

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, Mehul will acknowledge it as soon as reasonably possible. Please note that response times may vary, especially if Mehul is traveling.

For high-severity vulnerabilities, all repository contributors will investigate and address them as soon as possible. For medium to low-severity vulnerabilities, please allow up to a week for a resolution.

### Fix and Resolution

If the fix for a vulnerability is considered stable during development, it will be directly pushed to the `main` branch. Otherwise, it will be pushed to the 'wip' (work in progress) branch for testing to ensure stability before deployment.

Reporters are encouraged to issue their own pull requests with fixes or propose solutions for identified vulnerabilities.

During code reviews, it is ensured that no open secrets are visible to the public, and dependency versions are checked to ensure they include the latest security patches.

### Dependency Management

Dependabot is configured to manage all dependencies and update them automatically. Updates are checked daily to ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest security patches.

### Confidentiality and False Reports

Only Mehul will have access to the original vulnerability report. If desired, the reporter's email may be masked to maintain confidentiality. No repercussions will be taken if the report is found to be false.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. Reporters can help improve the security of the project by following these steps and responsibly reporting vulnerabilities as they are found.

For more information on how to contribute to the repository, please reach out to Mehul for more information.
