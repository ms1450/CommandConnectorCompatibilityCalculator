# Camera Model Comparison Script

## Overview

This script analyzes CSV files containing third-party camera models and compares them against our CSV of Command Connector-compatible models. It identifies camera model columns, finds exact matches, recognizes models with slight name variations, and suggests potential matches for similar models.

### Features

- **Exact Match Detection**: Identifies camera models that match exactly with Command Connector-compatible models.
- **Identification of Similar Models**: Recognizes models even when their names are slightly different.
- **Potential Matches**: Suggests potential matches for models that are similar but not exact.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this script is to provide a quick and accurate estimate of how many cameras in a given inventory would be supported by the Command Connector.

## Testing and Contributions

To ensure the script's robustness and error handling capabilities, we need to test it against a diverse range of data. If you have any Excel or CSV files from customers listing their current camera models, please share them with us at <mehul.sen@verkada.com> for testing purposes.

Thank you!
